# Stock Screening Script Using yFinance

This Python script screens a list of stock tickers using Yahoo Finance data via the `yfinance` library. It calculates several financial metrics, including:

- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
- Interest Coverage Ratio
- Gross Margin
- Net Margin
- Cash Conversion Ratio (Operating Cash Flow / Net Income)

Based on these metrics, it calculates an overall score (0â€“100) for each stock and exports the results to a color-coded HTML file (`screened_stocks.html`).
