# Stock Screening Script Using yFinance

This Python script screens a list of stock tickers using Yahoo Finance data via the `yfinance` library. It calculates several financial metrics, including:

- Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
- Interest Coverage Ratio
- Gross Margin
- Net Margin
- Cash Conversion Ratio (Operating Cash Flow / Net Income)

Based on these metrics, it calculates an overall score (0â€“100) for each stock and exports the results to a color-coded HTML file (`screened_stocks.html`).

## Updating Ticker List
The application now downloads the latest list of U.S. and Canadian tickers at
startup using `fetch_latest_tickers()` in `ticker_fetcher.py`. The function
retrieves ticker data from the MarketCap API. If the download fails, it falls
back to the cached `tickers.csv` file.

`fetch_latest_tickers()` expects the JSON response to include the fields
`symbol`, `name`, `is_etf` and `exchange`. The script then queries Yahoo
Finance for each ticker to obtain the current market cap, which is added to the
resulting DataFrame.

## Parsing Nasdaq Screener JSON

The repository also includes `parse_nasdaq_rows.py` for working with the raw
JSON from the Nasdaq screener. The utility extracts the `symbol`, `name`,
`marketCap` and `country` fields from the `rows` array.

Run it by passing the downloaded JSON file:

```bash
python parse_nasdaq_rows.py nasdaq.json > clean_rows.json
```

The output is a simplified list of dictionaries containing only the selected
fields.
